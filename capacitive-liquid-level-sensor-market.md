<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Capacitive Liquid Level Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Capacitive Liquid Level Sensor</li><li>Non-contact Capacitive Liquid Level Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Capacitive liquid level sensors are available in two main types: contact and non-contact sensors. Contact capacitive sensors require physical contact with the liquid to measure its level, whereas non-contact sensors can detect the level without touching the liquid. Contact sensors are commonly used in applications where direct contact with the liquid is possible, while non-contact sensors are preferred for situations where maintaining a sanitary environment or avoiding contamination is important. Both types of sensors offer precise and reliable liquid level measurements for various industrial applications.</p></p>
