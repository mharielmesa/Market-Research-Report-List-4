<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The OTR Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Solid Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>OTR tires come in three main types - Radial, Bias, and Solid tires. Radial tires have steel belts running across the tire to provide a smoother ride and better stability. Bias tires have layers of nylon cords laid in a crisscross pattern which makes them more durable but less flexible. Solid tires are made of solid rubber, typically used in applications where punctures are a concern. Each type has its own benefits and is used in different OTR applications based on their specific characteristics.</p></p>
