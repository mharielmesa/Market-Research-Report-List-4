<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Fizeau Interferometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Homodyne</li><li>Heterodyne</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laser Fizeau Interferometers are widely used in precision optical measurement applications. There are two main types of interferometers in the market - Homodyne and Heterodyne. </p><p>Homodyne interferometers use a single frequency laser source and a reference beam to interfere with the test beam, producing high-quality interference fringes. On the other hand, Heterodyne interferometers use two laser sources, one as a reference beam and the other as a test beam, with different frequencies to produce interference fringes. Both types have their specific advantages and are chosen based on the specific measurement requirements.</p></p>
