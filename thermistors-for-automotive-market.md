<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermistors for Automotive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PTC Type</li><li>NTC Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermistors are temperature-sensitive resistors widely used in the automotive market, primarily categorized into two types: Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) and Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistors. PTC thermistors increase resistance with rising temperature, making them ideal for overcurrent protection and heating applications. Conversely, NTC thermistors decrease resistance as temperature increases, which is commonly utilized for temperature sensing, engine management, and battery monitoring. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing vehicle performance, safety, and efficiency.</p></p>
