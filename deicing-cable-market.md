<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deicing Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Regulating Deicing Systems</li><li>Constant Wattage Deicing Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Deicing cables are commonly categorized into two main types: self-regulating deicing systems and constant wattage deicing systems. Self-regulating deicing systems automatically adjust their heat output based on temperature changes, making them more energy-efficient and cost-effective. Constant wattage deicing systems, on the other hand, provide a consistent level of heat output regardless of temperature fluctuations. Both types are used for preventing ice and snow buildup on roofs, gutters, and pipes in various residential, commercial, and industrial applications.</p></p>
