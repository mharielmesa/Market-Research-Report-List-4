<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmacokinetics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Noncompartmental Methods</li><li>Compartmental Methods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pharmacokinetics market can be broadly categorized into noncompartmental methods and compartmental methods. Noncompartmental methods involve analyzing drug concentrations over time without making assumptions about a specific model. This approach is simpler and more straightforward but may lack accuracy. On the other hand, compartmental methods involve modeling drug movement within the body using compartments to represent different tissues or organs. This method is more complex but provides a more detailed understanding of drug behavior and distribution.</p></p>
