<p><strong>The Glaucoma Medications Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-angle Glaucoma</li><li>Closed-angle Glaucoma</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glaucoma medications are used to treat both open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of the disease, where the fluid in the eye does not drain properly, causing increased pressure and potential damage to the optic nerve. Closed-angle glaucoma is less common but more severe, where the drainage angle in the eye becomes blocked suddenly, leading to a rapid increase in eye pressure. Glaucoma medications are crucial in managing both types of glaucoma and preventing vision loss.</p></p>
