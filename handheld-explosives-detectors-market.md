<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld Explosives Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Trace</li><li>Steam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Handheld explosives detectors can be categorized into two main types: trace detectors and steam detectors. Trace detectors use a special swab to collect trace amounts of explosive particles from surfaces, which are then analyzed for detection. On the other hand, steam detectors rely on the release of a vapor to interact with explosive molecules, producing a response that is detected by the device. Both types of detectors are crucial for security personnel and law enforcement agencies to detect and prevent potential threats in various environments.</p></p>
