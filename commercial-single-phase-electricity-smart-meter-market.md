<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Single Phase Electricity Smart Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IC Card</li><li>Non-IC Card</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial single-phase electricity smart meters come in two main types: IC card and non-IC card markets. IC card meters require users to pre-load credits onto a card, which is then inserted into the meter to pay for electricity usage. Non-IC card meters do not require a physical card for payment, typically utilizing digital or online platforms instead. Both markets cater to commercial businesses seeking efficient and cost-effective ways to monitor and manage their electricity usage.</p></p>
