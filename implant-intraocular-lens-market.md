<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implant Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-foldable Lenses</li><li>Foldable Intraocular Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-foldable intraocular lenses are rigid lenses that are inserted into the eye during cataract surgery and remain in a fixed position without the ability to be folded. These lenses are typically made of materials such as PMMA or silicone. Foldable intraocular lenses, on the other hand, are made of flexible materials that can be inserted through smaller incisions and then unfolded inside the eye. This allows for a less invasive surgical procedure and shorter recovery time for patients.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Implant Intraocular Lens Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic</li><li>Hydrophobic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Implant Intraocular Lens Market applications include hydrophilic and hydrophobic lenses. Hydrophilic lenses have a water-attracting surface that can prevent protein buildup and reduce the risk of infection, making them ideal for patients with dry eyes or a history of inflammation. On the other hand, hydrophobic lenses have a water-repelling surface that can resist protein buildup and provide better clarity of vision. Both types of lenses are commonly used in cataract surgery to replace the eye's natural lens.</p></p>
