<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three-phase Gear Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid-shaft Gear Motor</li><li>Hollow-shaft Gear Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Three-phase gear motors come in two main types: solid-shaft and hollow-shaft gear motors. Solid-shaft gear motors are designed with a solid shaft extending from the motor to directly drive the load. These motors are commonly used in applications where a direct connection is needed. On the other hand, hollow-shaft gear motors have a hollow bore at the center of the motor, allowing for the shaft of the load to pass through, providing a more flexible and adaptable solution for various applications.</p></p>
