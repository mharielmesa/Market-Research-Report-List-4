<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Caries Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transillumination</li><li>Laser Fluorescence</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Caries detectors are tools used by dentists to detect early signs of tooth decay. There are two main types of caries detectors on the market: transillumination and laser fluorescence. Transillumination involves shining a light through the tooth to detect any structural changes or cavities. Laser fluorescence, on the other hand, uses a laser light to detect changes in tooth density caused by decay. Both types of caries detectors are non-invasive and can help dentists accurately diagnose and treat tooth decay in its early stages.</p></p>
