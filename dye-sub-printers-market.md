ReTransfer printers use a two-step process where the image is first printed onto a clear film which is then transferred onto the card. This results in high-quality, durable prints with edge-to-edge coverage. Direct to Card printers, on the other hand, directly print the image onto the card surface. This process is faster and more cost-effective for smaller volume printing needs. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications based on printing requirements.</p></p>
