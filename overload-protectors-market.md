<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overload Protectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Manual</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Overload protectors are devices used to protect electrical systems from damage due to overload conditions. There are two main types of overload protectors: automatic and manual. Automatic overload protectors are designed to sense overload conditions and automatically shut off power to the system to prevent damage. Manual overload protectors require human intervention to reset or turn off power in the event of an overload. Both types serve the same purpose of preventing damage to electrical systems, but differ in terms of how they are activated.</p></p>
